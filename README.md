Wes Bos's 30 days of JS - js drumkit project

Simple js drum kit exercise from Wes Bos's 30 days of JS. I did it on my own without following the video, then watched the video to see what improvements I could make:
- I'd started off using CSS.escape to put the variable into the selector, but switched it out for the template string Wes used. 
- I changed the char codes and used the actual chars instead - bit more readable IMO.  
- I made it so you can click or type any of the keys to get the drum sounds
- I couldn't figure out how to get the sounds not to delay - had to watch the video to learn about playTrack.currentTime.

I should've committed throughout, but only remembered at the end. Oh well.
